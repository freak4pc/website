  <!-- What -->
  <h1 class="home__title home__title-what">What is Tuist?</h1>

  <p>
    Tuist is a command line tool that helps you <b>generate</b>, <b>maintain</b> and <b>interact</b> with Xcode projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tool is open source and written in <span class="home__what-swift">Swift</span>.
  </p>

  <!-- Defining projects -->
  <h2>Defining your projects</h2>

  <p>
    With Tuist, projects are defined in a <i>Project.swift</i>, also known as manifest. The manifest format that abstracts you from the implementation details of Xcode projects. In your manifest you can define which targets your project has, which sources and resources belong to them, as well as the dependencies with targets in the same and other projects. The advantages of defining the projects in a manifest are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>It can <b>catch misconfigurations and fail early</b>. For example, if a target has an invalid dependency, it’ll let you know before you start compiling the app.</li>
    <li>Since the manifest doesn’t include Xcode implementation details, it's <b>more unlikely to have git conflicts</b> related to projects.
    </li>
    <li><b>It makes the configuration easier</b>. The decision on how the project looks is on you. Tuist processes it and manages the complexity for you. One example of that complexity is setting up dependencies between targets.</li>
  </ul>

  The example below shows the format of a project manifest:

  {% highlight swift %}
  import ProjectDescription

  let project = Project(name: "App",
                        targets: [
                          Target(name: "App",
                                platform: .iOS,
                                product: .app,
                                bundleId: "io.tuist.App",
                                infoPlist: "Info.plist",
                                sources: "Sources/**",
                                dependencies: [
                                    /* .framework(path: "framework") */
                                  ]),
                          Target(name: "AppTests",
                                platform: .iOS,
                                product: .unitTests,
                                bundleId: "io.tuist.AppTests",
                                infoPlist: "Tests.plist",
                                sources: "Tests/**",
                                dependencies: [
                                      .target(name: "App")
                                ])
                        ])
  {% endhighlight %}

  <!-- Interacting with them-->
  <h2>Interacting with them</h2>

  <p>Tuist leverages project generation to provide a <b>simple and convenient set of commands</b>, standard across all the projects. The commands infer most of the necessary information from your projects, requiring you to pass only the arguments that are strictly necessary.</p>

  <p>Having a standard command line interface makes it easier to jump between projects since there’s an interaction language everyone in the team is familiar with.</p>

  <p class="home__commands--container">
      <img class="home__commands" src="/images/commands.jpg" alt="All available commands"/>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Init:</b> Bootstraps a new project. You can specify the platform and the type of project and it’ll generate all the necessary artifacts <i>(Info.plist, AppDelegate, Project.swift, Playgrounds…)</i></li>
    <li><b>Generate:</b> Generates the Xcode workspace and projects to work on a particular project.</li>
    <li><b>Build:</b> Builds the project in the current directory. It supports all the arguments that xcodebuild supports. <i class="home__command-not-available">(Not available yet)</i></li>
    <li><b>Test:</b> Test the project in the current directory. It supports all the arguments that xcodebuild supports. <i class="home__command-not-available">(Not available yet)</i></li>
    <li><b>Run:</b> Runs the project. If the project needs a device to run on, it’ll prompt you to select one. <i class="home__command-not-available">(Not available yet)</i></li>
    <li><b>Release:</b> Builds and publishes your project on iTunes Connect. <i class="home__command-not-available">(Not available yet)</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The list of actions will likely grow as we get feedback from you.

  <!-- When -->
  <h1 class="home__title">When should I use it?</h1>

  <p>
    Here are some good situations when we think you should consider using Tuist:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><span class="home__why--when">When</span> my projects and workspaces are too complex and only a few people in the team know how to configure them.</li>
    <li><span class="home__why--when">When</span> there are so many people commiting to the project that a lot of time is spent solving git conflicts.</li>
    <li><span class="home__why--when">When</span> I have many similar automation scripts and files, and need some standarization.</li>
    <li><span class="home__why--when">When</span> I need reliability on the automation layer but I don't have resources to work on that domain.</li> 
    <li><span class="home__why--when">When</span> I want to be able to run my apps executing a command on the terminal.</li>
    <li><span class="home__why--when">When</span> I want to understand the project structure at a glance without getting lost in a .pbxproj file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1 class="home__title">How can I adopt it?</h1>
  <p>
    Considering adopting Tuist? You can introduce it incrementally in your projects.
  </p>

  <div class="home__grid">
    <div class="home__box">
      <span class="home__box-title">
        1. Project Generation
      </span>
      <div class="home__box-excerpt">
        Define a <i>Project.swift</i> for each of your projects and use Tuist to generate the Xcode projects. You can keep using your existing tools and scripts <i>(CocoaPods, Carthage, Fastlane).</i>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="home__box">
      <span class="home__box-title">
        2. CLI
      </span>
      <div class="home__box-excerpt">
        Leverage the commands that Tuist offers and avoid maintaining automation scripts or <i>Fastfiles</i> yourself. Set up your CI pipelines to use Tuist instead and onboard your team on how those commands work.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <br/>
  
  <p>
    That's it! How tedious the process will be depends on how complex your projects are. Unfortunately, we can't generate the manifest files from your existing projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you can see, <b>Tuist doesn't force you to change your projects structure, or CI setup</b>. If you regret the adoption of the tool, you can easily drop it.
